What's the most cost effective way to have a middleman between the storage and the client? To avoid multiple reads directly from the S3 bucket? 

============================

To reduce costs and avoid excessive direct reads from Google Cloud Storage (GCS), you can introduce a caching layer between your React app and GCS. Here are a few cost-effective approaches:

1. Use a CDN (Recommended)
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) caches and serves images closer to users, reducing requests to GCS.

Cloudflare Free Plan: You can set up Cloudflare as a CDN to cache and serve your images.
Google Cloud CDN: If you want a Google-native solution, it caches images at the edge and reduces requests to GCS.
Netlify Large Media: If youâ€™re hosting on Netlify, consider its built-in caching features.
Setup Example for Cloudflare

Point a subdomain (e.g., cdn.yourdomain.com) to GCS using a Cloudflare proxy.
Set cache rules to ensure Cloudflare serves cached images instead of hitting GCS repeatedly.
ðŸ‘‰ Pros: Significantly reduces read costs from GCS.
ðŸ‘‰ Cons: Initial setup required.

2. Self-Hosted Image Proxy (More Control)
Instead of serving images directly from GCS, you can use a simple proxy API to serve cached images.

Option A: Use Firebase Functions (or Cloud Run)
Deploy a simple function that fetches images from GCS, caches them, and serves them to users.
Use Redis (via Upstash or Cloud Memorystore) to cache responses.

Option B: Use an Express Server with Caching
Deploy a lightweight Express server on Vercel, Railway, or Fly.io.
Store frequently accessed images in Redis or a temporary in-memory cache.
ðŸ‘‰ Pros: More control, can optimize caching strategies.
ðŸ‘‰ Cons: Adds some complexity compared to a CDN.

3. Pre-Generate Static Image URLs for the Gallery
If the gallery content is mostly static (not user-generated dynamically), consider:

Running a cron job that pre-fetches and stores image URLs in a JSON file (e.g., hosted on Netlify).
Using statically generated pages (Next.js SSG) for the gallery.
ðŸ‘‰ Pros: No backend costs, ultra-fast.
ðŸ‘‰ Cons: Not ideal if new images are constantly uploaded.
