Using Cloudflare's Free CDN (Best for Static Images)
Cloudflare will cache images and serve them from its edge network, reducing requests to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

Steps to Set Up Cloudflare as a CDN for GCS
âœ… Step 1: Make Your GCS Bucket Public

Go to Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to Cloud Storage > Your Bucket.
Click on Permissions â†’ Add principal.

Add allUsers with the role Storage Object Viewer (to make objects publicly readable).
Your public URL for an image will be: https://storage.googleapis.com/YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/image.jpg

Step 2: Set Up a Custom Domain in Cloudflare

Sign up at Cloudflare and add your domain.
In the DNS settings, create a CNAME record:

```
Name: cdn
Target: storage.googleapis.com
Proxy Status: Proxied (orange cloud)
```

Now, instead of hitting GCS directly, users will use: https://cdn.yourdomain.com/image.jpg

Cloudflare will cache the images at its edge locations.

âœ… Step 3: Adjust Cache Rules in Cloudflare

Go to Caching > Cache Rules.

Add a rule:
URL Pattern: cdn.yourdomain.com/*
Cache Level: "Cache Everything"
Edge Cache TTL: 1 month (adjust based on frequency of changes).

ðŸ‘‰ Benefit: Cloudflare serves cached images instead of requesting them from GCS, reducing costs and increasing speed.
